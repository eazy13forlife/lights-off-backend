# Lights Off
Lights Off is going to be a fully responsive, full stack movie/tv show application with a bunch of fun features.

## Technologies I'll be using
* PostgreSQL
* SQL
* Node.js
* Express
* At some point, I will redo this project using Java

## My Current Idea
* User will need to login in order to be authenticated (use jwt)
* User will need to verify their account via a code that will be sent to their email 
* Include a forgot password link
* Hash password using bcrypt or should I use OAuth for logging in?
* Since I will allow user to upload own movies, I will give them ability to upload an image/trailer so use AWS to store these images/video files
* I'm not even sure about allthe tables or relationships I want to have, but some off the top of head are Review,User, Movie, Show,Favorites,Seen,etc.
* Diagram models
* What if I added a currently showing in features option? and user can be redirected to the website of a theatre or whatever

## What I want to work on throughout this project
* Better commit messages and committing more often
*
