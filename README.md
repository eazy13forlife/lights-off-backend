Lights Off is a fully responsive, full stack movie/tv show application with a bunch of fun features.

## Technologies I'll be using
* PostgreSQL
* SQL
* Node.js
* Express
* Javascript

## Notable Features
* Fully responsive
* Login/SignUp page
* User's login info saved to local storage to prevent always having to log in
* User can save a movie or tv show to their favorites, watch next or seen lists. 
* Every movie or tv show has relevant information like release date, cast, genre, etc.
* User can search for movies and tv shows based on specific genres
* Users can review a movie or tv show and see all reviews for every movie and tv show
* User can search for people in the entertainment industry and look up all their film and tv credits


## Future idea implementations
* User will need to verify their account via a code that will be sent to their email 
* Include a forgot password link
* Use OAuth for logging in
* Allow users ability to upload own movies and give them the ability to upload an image/trailer so use AWS to store these images/video files
* Add a currently showing in theatres option. And the user can be redirected to the website of a specific theatre or ticketing company.

## What I want to work on throughout this project
* Better commit messages and committing more often
* Make sure my tables are normalized up to third normal form
